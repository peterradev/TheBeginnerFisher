        "description": "Name basically describes what they are, just a stick of plastic without a tail or appendages. But there are many different ways of fishing it, just like most of all the different soft plastic baits. One of the most popular ways to fish the stick worm is called Wacky Style or Wacky Rig. To set this up you put the hook through the center of the worm. Then when you cast it out, is to slowly reel the bait in by raising and lowering your rod which in turns raises and lowers the worm."
